CI & Deployments
============

You can deploy the solution however you wish as it is ultimately a standard .net web application.


##CI
We would recommend services such as [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) or [Appveyor](http://www.appveyor.com/) to compile and package your solution.

##Deployment

We recommend a tool such as [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/) to deploy your solution.

## Content
It is always best to version the key items in your CMS to ensure promotion between environments goes smoothly.
### Umbraco

To do this in Umbraco, you should a tool such as [Courier](http://umbraco.com/products-and-support).
### Sitecore 
To do this in Sitecore, you should a tool such as [Sitecore.Ship](https://github.com/kevinobee/Sitecore.Ship) or [TDS](https://www.hhogdev.com/products/team-development-for-sitecore/overview.aspx)
